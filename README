What is ALU (Automatically Load URL)
====================================

ALU is a very small peace of code written in HTML and Javascript and designed to
automatically load an URL and display the content of the URL inside an iframe.

Is ALU polished and complete
============================

No. Really no. ALU was designed for a very special setting (read below) and never
meant to do anything else. However feel free to make it better in every single
way.

What can ALU be used for
========================

ALU was designed for a very special setting. A random user presented a smartcard
to a smartcard reader. The only content of the smartcard was a personalized URL for
that particlar user. The goal was, that the URL on the smartcard was automatically read,
opened and the content of the URL presented to the user in an iframe inside the
browser window. The smartcard reader behaved like pasted text from a keyboard.

What ALU can´t do
=================

ALU will NOT work with websites that send the "X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN" header (like 
Google and Amazon do).

Read here why: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options 

What types of URL´s are supported
=================================

Currently ALU only supports http and https (e.g. http://www.yoururl.com or 
https://www.anotherurl.com).

How does ALU work
=================

ALU uses HTML and Javascript. ALU uses a textbox that "waits" for the user input.
Only input that is provided in one piece will work, for example if you paste an
URL to the textbox. 

ALU then loads this input into an iframe (the content of the url) and clears the
input textbox, so that it is ready for the next input.

How ALU can be configured
=========================

ALU can be configured directly within the alu.html. However the only real things
to configure are the height and width of the iframe, which are hardcoded to
1024px width and 768px height.

Because ALU is plain HTML and Javascript you can change / configure it to nearly
anything you want it to be.
